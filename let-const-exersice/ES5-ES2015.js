QUIZ:
#1: the difference between var and let is var is function wide scope and can be redeclared and let is block code scoped and can only be declared once
#2: the difference between var and const is that variables declared with var can have their data changed while const's are constant, they are a static value
#3: the difference between let and const is that they have the same scope and declaration laws but variables declared with let can have their data changed
#4: Hoisting is a trait of variables declared with var, the name itself will be initialized before everything else as undefined, that is why its called hoisting,
        and only when JavaScript gets to your actual declaration of the var will it update the value from undefined -> your value.
